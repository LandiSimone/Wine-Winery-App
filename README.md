# Distributed Large Scale Application
Wine-Winery-App
WineWinery is a Java Large Scale application designed for wine lovers to share experiences and feelings about bottles.
Users can search and comment wine bottles in the application. Bottle informations come from two different sources and are easily and quickly available through the application's interface.
Each user can create their own wineries and add the bottles present in the application to them. 
In addition, WineWinery has a social component that allows users to interact by going to like bottles and offering the ability to follow users and wineries.

To keep the bottle database updated, the project includes DB_update, a Python script, which can be run from the command line. This script allows you to initialize the database or update it with the latest available bottle information.
